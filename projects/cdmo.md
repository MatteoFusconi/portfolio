This project solves the Multiple Couriers Planning problem, developed as a group project for the Combinatorial Decision Making and Optimization exam at Alma Mater Studiorum (Unibo) by Francesco Pivi, Matteo Fusconi, Shola Oshodi and Niccol√≤ Marzi.

The problem consist in finding the shortest route for a number m of couriers who have to deliver a number n of items, without exceeding their load capacity. We solved this problem with four different approaches:

<li> Constraint Programming (CP) through the python API of Minizinc
<li> SAT through Z3 python library
<li> Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) Z3 python library and with SMTlib
<li> Mixed Integer Linear Programming (LP) through PuLP python library
