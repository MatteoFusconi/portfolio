#### Abstract
Computer vision technology plays a crucial role in various applications today, from very simple classification models to more complex systems such as autonomous driving. As the use of these models becomes more widespread, ensuring both their efficiency and fairness is increasingly important. This work focuses on analyzing biases in computer vision models, with an emphasis on two key applications: face recognition and skin disease prediction. For face recognition, we explore biases in FaceNet, a leading model in the field, and propose strategies to improve its fairness and accuracy across diverse demographic groups. For skin disease prediction, we examine a pretrained ResNet-50 model, identifying potential biases that may affect the reliability of predictions for different skin tones. By fine-tuning these models and implementing bias mitigation techniques, we aim to enhance their performance, making computer vision systems more inclusive and equitable. This work contributes to the development of more trustworthy and effective AI technologies for various real-world applications.
