##### Abstract

In this study, we tackle two main challenges in quantitative finance: selecting an optimal stock portfolio and improving returns annually. To achieve this, we leverage various clustering techniques to identify promising shares for the upcoming month across different markets. We then optimize portfolio weights based on the Sharpe ratio. Finally, we tune different models to guide investment decisions for the following month. Our results reveal superior performance compared to the FTSEMIB index in the Italian market, while achieving outcomes comparable to the S&P 500. This difference may be attributed to the higher liquidity in the American one, renowned for its resilience during crashes and rapid recovery mechanisms.
